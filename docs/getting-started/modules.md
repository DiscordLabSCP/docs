# Modules

## What is a module?

A module is a plugin made to connect with DiscordLab and give seamless integration without needing a second Discord bot
for one server, anyone and everyone can make their own plugin, integration with public plugins can even be done
without needing to have a module made by the DiscordLab team themselves.

## Installing a module

To install a module, we have made a simple Discord bot command and LocalAdmin command to install modules, you can
run either of these commands to install a module.

#### Discord Command
`/discordlab install <module name>`

#### LocalAdmin Command
`discordlab install <module name>`

You can also install a module by downloading the module from the [DiscordLab GitHub](https://github.com/DiscordLabSCP/DiscordLab) and placing it in the `EXILED/Plugins` folder.

## Configuring a module

Each module has its own configuration, you can find the configuration in a similar place to where you found the main bot's configuration. If you want to understand what each option does, you can look at the comment added to the config option.
You can also look at our modules documentation for more information on each module. You can find this on the left hand side of this page.

Easiest way to find modules is by using the `discordlab list` command either in Discord or LocalAdmin, or you can just check the modules on the left hand side.
